These particles, such as electrons, protons, and neutrons, are the fundamental constituents of matter and energy. Understanding subatomic particles is crucial in exploring quantum mechanics, particle physics, and the fundamental forces that shape the universe. Researchers study subatomic particles through experiments in particle colliders like the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), aiming to discover new particles and understand their properties. Applications of subatomic research include advancements in technology, such as semiconductors and medical imaging devices, and contributions to our understanding of cosmology, including dark matter and dark energy.",
